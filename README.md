# Open Source Module

GreetingsðŸŽ‰!

We hope you have gone through the resources and understood the basics of Git and GitHub which is essential for contributing to open source projects
Now it's time to test your understanding through a task. The task has been divided into 3 subtasks with increasing level of difficulty. The points associated with the tasks also increase proportionately with their difficulty.

Also note that it is not mandatory to attempt all the subtasks. You can attempt whichever task you want. However, attempting more tasks will increase your chances of selection for interviews.

## Sub Task 1 :

Create a repository on your local machine and then push it to your GitHub account. Make sure that your repository is public (and not private). Now add a basic README to the repository. In the README add your details like name roll number branch etc. Also add a brief description about yourself. Push the changes to your repository.

## Sub Task 2:

- Create a new branch in your repository. Edit your README by adding a few lines about why you want to contribute to open source. Commit these changes to the branch. Merge the two branches.
- Fork and clone the repo Coding Week 22 Task from the [Coding Club](https://github.com/codingiitg) GitHub Account. In the repository there will be a template hello world program. Create a new file with name `roll_no.cpp` with the same content as of the Template program and change the word `world` to your name and generate a pull request.

    Note : You need to record your screen while doing these tasks from Sub Task 2. These tasks should be done from the command line ( GitHub Desktop should not be used). Also introduce yourself in the beginning of the video.

## Sub Task 3:
Create a [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) in a new repository demonstrating a simple and creative workflow. It's upto the participants on what they want to build. For this task, participants will be judged on the creativity of the workflow they will implement with Github Action.

Examples:
- A action which adds patience quotes/memes in every new PR created
- A action which updates blog links on your github profile page on every new commit

You can also create useful github action for proper deployment or CI/CD.

Try to be as creative as possible ;)



## Note:

Though doing all the tasks is not necessary, the more you will attempt the better the chances will be of getting higher points from Heads.
